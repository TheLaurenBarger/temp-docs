My home context is a little backward. When I went into electrical engineering and subsequently IT, I had to promise my mom that I wouldn’t stop art. I remember her being excited to think that maybe I would be a designer and build web pages and digital art.

I’m a backend dev.

Here’s to keeping promises that you make to your mom ❤️.
